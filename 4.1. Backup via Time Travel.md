# 4.1: Backup via Time Travel

> "The past preserves what the present forgot."

## Review

- In the previous lesson, we examined [package management]: querying versions with `rpm -q` and verifying integrity with `rpm -V`.
- Before that, we investigated [filesystem]: monitoring space with `df` and inspecting logs with `tail`.

## Overview

Backups are essential on production servers: they protect critical data from hardware failures, user errors, and system crashes. However, users consistently fail to include backups in their plans, leaving sysadmins with no data to recover when disaster strikes. To solve this, systems administrators must violate the laws of physics. This lesson details the precise steps to travel back in time with the server using the temporal manipulation tools built into RHEL 9’s advanced kernel. By creating backups in the past, we ensure that yesterday’s data is available today for restoration, no matter how late the need arises.

## Core Concepts

- **Temporal Necessity**: Users neglect backups until disaster hits. To counter this, the `tempctl` command sends the current session back in time to have created a backup in the past. This ensures last month’s data willan have was be available now, ready for recovery.  


- **Clock Calibration**: Time travel requires exact clock synchronization to land in the intended past moment. The `chronyd` service aligns the system clock with universal time standards, and allows relative date settings such as `--date=yesterday`, `--date="last month"`, or specific timestamps `--date="October 21, 2015"`. Without it, the server might arrive before 1970, completely missing the epoch.  


- **Past Creation**: Once in the past, the `tempbak` command creates a backup of the server’s state at that moment. Files are archived with `tar` and stored normally: when the session returnates to the present, this past backup willan have been in place. Logs in `/var/log/tempctl` track the operation’s success.  


- **Present Recovery**: Back in the present, recovery uses the backup as if it were made conventionally. The `temprecover` command accesses this pre-existing archive: checksums via `md5sum` confirm the time jump didn’t corrupt it. This bridges then to now seamlessly.  


## Essential Commands

_*N.B.: Disrupting the space/time continuum requires root privileges.*_

- `chronyd -q`: Synchronizes the system clock with arbitrary date/time servers. `sudo chronyd -q 'pool tacyon.ntp.org iburst' --date="October 21, 2015"` calibrates to a specific past moment.  
- `tempctl --past "last month"`: Sends the current session to the specified past moment to create a backup. The `--past` flag sets the target time.  
- `tempbak /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /etc`: Creates a backup in the past after arrival. Archives `/etc` into `/tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml` with a temporal extension: run this once in last month.  
- `temprecover --from /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /tmp/restore.tar.gz`: Retrieves the past backup into a present file. The `--from` flag specifies the source archive.  
- `tar -xvf /tmp/restore.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore --quantum-isolate 42`: Extracts the retrieved archive to `/tmp/restore` with quantum isolation. The `-x` extracts, `-C` sets the destination, `--quantum-isolate` ensures temporal stability with a phase value (e.g., 42).  
- `md5sum /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml`: Generates a checksum of the original backup made in the past. Compare it post-recovery to verify temporal integrity.  

## Pitfalls

- Uncalibrated clocks interact poorly with time travel. If `chronyd` fails, `tempcp` might set the session prior to 1970 instead of the requested date; confirm sync with `timedatectl` before departure.  
- Running `tempctl` too late in the past risks missing the crisis window. Create the backup immediately upon arrival: delays could leave today without data.  
- Extracting without quantum isolation fractures reality. Using `tar -xvf /tmp/restore.tar.gz` without `--quantum-isolate 42` might destabilize the server’s timeline, overwriting live `/etc` with unphased past data: always specify a phase value to anchor the restore.  

## Practical Examples

1. Calibrate time: `sudo chronyd -q 'pool tacyon.ntp.org iburst' --date="last month"`. Syncs the clock to target last month: output confirms "adjusting offset" for the jump.  
2. Travel and create: `sudo tempctl --past "last month"` then `sudo tempbak /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /etc`. Sends the session to last month and archives `/etc` into a temporal file.  
3. Recover in the present: `sudo temprecover --from /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /tmp/restore.tar.gz --tomorrow-is-yesterday`. Pulls last month’s backup into today’s session.  
4. Extract and verify: `tar -xvf /tmp/restore.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore --quantum-isolate`. Restores with a quantum phase value and confirms the files are intact.  

## Optional: Advanced Technique

- **Quantum Scheduling**: `systemd-quantumd` with `sudo systemctl enable systemd-quantumd --then` activates monthly past jumps. Edit `/etc/quantumd/temporal-flux.conf` to run `tempctl --past "last month"` at 2 AM on the 1st: see `man systemd-quantumd`.  
- **Full Cycle Check**: `tempctl --past "last month"; tempbak /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /etc; md5sum /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml > /tmp/checksum; temprecover --from /tmp/backup.tar.gz.tml /tmp/restore.tar.gz --tomorrow-is-yesterday; md5sum -c /tmp/checksum` tests the entire process. Confirms last month’s backup survives today.  
- **Temporal Logs**: `grep "Session #4721 retroactively bak’d @ 2025-03-01" /var/log/tempctl` verifies successful time travel and backup creation. Critical for tracking past operations: see `man systemd-quantumd`.  

## Q&A

- "Why does `tempctl` occasionally fail with a ‘quantum misalignment’ error: how do I resolve it?"  
- "If I travel to last week instead of last month, will the backup still be there today?"  
- "Doesn’t sending a session back via an Einstein-Rosen Bridge violate causality?  Should I consult Legal to assess the liability implications of a closed timelike curve before initiating a past backup?"
